			using my dashboard reports to improve business insight and WOW! 
			their managers. Here's why...</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="" height="8" width="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" />
			&nbsp;Good Excel dashboards can save <em>hours</em> of time...when you update your reports, and when your managers 
			and other VIPs read them.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="" height="8" width="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" />
			&nbsp;Excel 
			dashboards can present data from any number of sources in one 
			report. Even in one chart. </p>
			<p>
			<img alt="" height="8" width="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" /> 
			&nbsp;They're created and maintained by users, who understand what 
			the information means, not by programmers, who usually don't. </p>
			<p>
			<img alt="" height="8" width="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" />
			&nbsp;They're a spreadsheet solution, not a macro solution.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="" height="8" width="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" /> 
			&nbsp;They can adapt quickly -- often, in minutes -- to managers' 
			changing information needs.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="" height="8" width="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" /> 
			&nbsp;They can trap errors that normal reports typically ignore.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="" height="8" width="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" /> 
			&nbsp;And, because you already own Excel, your dashboard software costs 
			nothing extra...it's free!</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, few people know how to create <em>useable</em> Excel dashboards. 
			But because this is such an important topic, I want to provide you 
			with everything you need to produce your own dashboard reports. 
			That's why I created the Excel Dashboard Kit.</p>
			<p>The kit includes my e-book, <em>Dashboard Reporting With 
			Excel</em>, and more than 20 Excel workbooks. You'll learn more about the 
			book and the kit below.</p>
		<h3 class="head3">An Overview of the E-Book</h3>
			<p>I 
		used to <em>hate</em> spreadsheet reporting.</p><p>As a manager, I hated to 
		receive those long Excel reports. I hated to slog through those stacks of 
		paper, each page with long columns of tiny 
		numbers.</p>
		Somewhere...somewhere in all those numbers were key 
		trends and exceptions that I needed to recognize as serious problems and 
		opportunities. I hated the thought that I was missing so much treasure 
		hidden in so much clutter. <p>As a spreadsheet user, I hated to 
		prepare those reports. I hated to spend long hours, month after month, 
		turning the crank, producing reports that people often ignored.<br />
		<br />(One time, I accidentally printed three copies of the same page in the same report. No one noticed.)</p>
				<p>Then I found a solution an old copy of the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>.</p><p>The article 
				was 
		written in 1979 by George Blake, the VP Finance of one of the 
		largest companies in Mexico. It explained how his company was using many 
		small graphs on one page to report management performance.</p>
				<p>(His small charts were much like the <em>mini-charts </em>I 
				show below.)</p><p>In 
		seconds, his managers could recognize critical trends. They could 
		compare one measure of performance to another. They could ignore the 
		expected and concentrate on the surprises. They were freed from those 
		many pages of long columns of tiny numbers.</p>

			<p>I fell in love with 
		dashboards!</p><p>
			
			Back then, I was working on my first book, <em>Financial 
		Modeling Using Lotus 1-2-3</em>. Because we couldn't 
		create small charts in 1-2-3, I added a chapter that showed how to create 
		&quot;mini-graphs&quot; using text characters in spreadsheets. This solution was 
		primitive, but popular.</p>
		<p>Then Microsoft introduced Excel, 
		and I fell in love all over again. With Excel, I could deliver professional-quality management 
		reports.</p>
		
		<p>
			
			Finally, in 2004 -- after nearly fifteen years of development -- I 
		decided to show Excel users the amazing results we could get from 
		dashboard reporting with Excel. I had to tell 
		Excel users about the reporting power they already have at their 
		fingertips! </p>
		<p>The version for Classic Excel (2003 and before) is 150 pages long; 
		the version for New Excel (2007 and after) is 200 pages. </p>
		<p>These books explain two 
		key topics:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>They explain how to create Excel dashboard reports that provide 
			readers with more information, more quickly, than with any other 
			form of reporting I know of.<br /><br /></li>
			<li>They 
		explain how to make your dashboards and other reports quick and easy to update by 
			linking them to a spreadsheet database.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Both topics are mandatory. You never, NEVER want to create an Excel 
		dashboard report that you can't update quickly. </p>
		<p>At last count, <a href="../../about/testimonials_from_users.htm">enthusiastic Excel users</a> in&nbsp;at 
		least 165 countries have purchased my Excel dashboard books and 
		templates.&nbsp; </p>

			Here's a 
		description of each chapter:<p>
			<strong>1. The Advantages of Dashboard 
		Reporting With Excel.</strong> This short introductory chapter tells much about 
		what you already know if you spend much time on this site: Excel can 
		produce great dashboard reports. </p>
			<p>I call them &quot;magazine-quality&quot; reports. 
		I also introduce the Management-Reporting Pyramid, which is the best way 
		I've found to describe the level of detail that managers need in their 
		reports.</p>
				<p>
				
				<strong>
				<img class="image-right" alt="Mini-chart for Excel dashboards" height="155" src="images/mini-charts.gif" width="406" />2. How to Create Mini-Charts for Dashboard Reporting.</strong> 
				The chart on the left is a typical Excel chart that's been 
				reduced to a small size. The chart on the right is a <em>
				mini-chart</em>, which is a key ingredient of Excel dashboard reporting. </p>
				<p>The step-by-step instructions in this chapter show you how to 
				easily convert your charts from small, unreadable ones into 
				mini-charts that your managers can read easily.</p>
		
		<p><strong>3. Charting 
		Techniques for Dashboard Reporting.</strong> There's more to dashboard reporting 
		than merely creating small charts. This chapter discusses a variety of 
		other techniques to enhance charting for dashboard reporting. I compare 
		gauges, which Excel doesn’t support, to far better display methods that 
		Excel does support.</p><p><strong>4. Create Figures that Use Both Charts and 
		Worksheets.</strong> Much of dashboard reporting uses spreadsheet cells to 
		complement charts. This chapter describes typical techniques. The 
		chapter also explains how to force charts to work together. In<span class="style14"> the 
		dark-red 
		figure on the right below,</span> for example, each column of charts uses the same Y-axis 
		values. This allows readers to compare each company’s 
		performance within each column of the report.</p><p><strong>
				<img class="image-right" alt="Excel camera tool" height="234" src="images/camera2.gif" width="130" />5. How to Use Excel’s Camera 
		Tool.</strong> Most users ignore Excel's Camera Tool, but it's crucial for 
		adding tables to Excel 
		dashboard reports. This chapter describes a variety of 
		reporting techniques that only Excel's Camera Tool can achieve. </p>
				<p>For example, 
				in dashboards we often need to display tables that use row or 
				column spacing that doesn't line up with with the worksheet that 
				displays the tables. And we occasionally need to rotate a table 
				for various reasons. </p>
				<p>In this extreme example, the boundaries of the two tables 
				don't line up with the underlying worksheet; and both tables 
				have been rotated 90 degrees. However, both tables still are dynamic. 
				That is, their values still change as the data changes.</p>
				<p>This chapter explains many reasons to use the Camera Tool, 
				and how to use it easily. </p>
				<p><strong>6. How 
		to Funnel Data into Dashboard Reports.</strong> At first glance, dashboard 
		reporting is all about ways to create a great-looking report page. But 
		the real challenge for Excel users is this: How do we update Excel 
		easily so that dashboards don’t quickly send us to Spreadsheet Hell? 
		This chapter explains the key ways to flow data into your dashboards 
				easily, including 
		PivotTables, Excel-friendly OLAP, and the INDEX-MATCH functionality.<br />
		<br /><strong>7. How to Use Spreadsheet Databases for Dashboard Reporting.</strong> In my 
		experience, most spreadsheet databases are badly managed. As a 
		consequence, they often cause more trouble than they're worth. This 
		chapter explains a simple way to set up spreadsheet databases for 
		reliable spreadsheet reporting.</p><p>
			<strong>8. How to Build Dashboard Reports 
		in Excel.</strong> This is the key chapter in the book. It explains the steps 
		necessary to create this Excel dashboard report. Here, the charts are 
				all mini-charts (chapter 2) and the tables rely on the Camera 
				Tool (chapter 6).</p>
				<p>
				<img alt="" height="403" src="images/dashboard.jpg" width="600" />&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
				More 
		importantly, this chapter explains how, each period, <em>you easily can update 
				your dashboards in seconds! </em></p>
		<p><strong>9. Magazine-Quality 
		Dashboard Designs.</strong> As a general rule, Excel users aren't known for their 
		artistic skills. This can be a problem when we're trying to create 
		professional-quality dashboard reports. </p>
				<p>So what can we do if we don't 
		have the skills to create good-looking designs? We steal them, of 
		course! Before Bloomberg bought <em>Business Week</em>, 
		BW published great charts and tables. But these days, <em>The Wall 
		Street Journal</em> is my favorite source of examples. This chapter 
		provides a variety of charts and tables that illustrate my &quot;thieving&quot; 
		techniques. For each illustration I briefly describe how to create 
		versions of those figures using Excel.</p>

			Information-rich Excel 
		dashboards offer the most effective way I know to explain business 
		performance. Excel users typically can modify these reports in a few 
		minutes, if the data is available. 
			<p>
			This means that managers finally can 
		have the information they need, when they need it, in a format that they 
		can understand easily. Finally, Excel users can use Excel to clearly 
		communicate business information.</p>
			<p>As far as I know, I'm the 
		only person in the world who has figured out how to (1) create great-looking 
		Excel dashboards, and (2) update them easily. And <em>Dashboard Reporting With 
		Excel</em> is the only book that shows you the important techniques.</p><h3 class="head3">

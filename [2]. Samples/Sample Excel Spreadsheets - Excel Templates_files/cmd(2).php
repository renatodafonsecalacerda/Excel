				<p>Do most of your Excel reports look somewhat like the gray 
				examples at the right above? </p>
				<p>If so, your audience must work <i>hard</i> to convert that 
				mass of data into useful insight. But your Excel reports don't 
				have to be that way. They could be <i>easy</i> to read and 
				understand. </p>
				<p>This page shows many dashboard reports and figures created 
				entirely with Excel. These &quot;magazine-quality&quot; dashboards act 
				like the dashboard of your car. They can present a massive 
				amount of useful information quickly and easily. </p>
				<p>Most Business Intelligence (BI) software costs many thousands 
				of dollars. It typically displays much less information per page 
				or screen than these reports do. And Subject Matter Experts like 
				you typically have less control over those expensive displays 
				than the IT department does. </p>
				<p>But because you already own Excel, you can create reports 
				like this for free. You only need ordinary Excel workbooks, with 
				no macros. </p>
				<p>To be clear, because you already own Excel you pay <i>nothing</i> 
				for the software needed to create these dashboard reports.</p>
				<p>Excel users in more than 160 countries are using Excel to 
				create reports like these for their managers, clients, 
				co-workers, or investors. You can see testimonials from some of 
				them on this page. </p>
				<p>You can create your own professional-quality reports, using 
				Excel on either a Windows or Mac computer.</p>
				<p>Of course, if there's something you want to change about 
				these reports, you can do so easily. This isn't complex 
				software. It's only Excel. <br />&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3>Three Dashboard Kits to Choose From</h3>
				<p>I offer three ways to create dashboard reports. </p>
				<p>1. If you need a dashboard report in a hurry, you can use my 
				new Quick-and-Easy Dashboard Kit Version 2 (QnE2). To generate 
				your first report in a few hours you merely...</p>
				
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>Choose a portrait or landscape report format. </li>
					<li>Enter your actual and target data (when you have 
					targets) in data worksheets.</li>
					<li>Apply a color theme.</li>
					<li>Recalculate your workbook (press F9) if your manual 
					calculation mode is set in Excel.</li>
					<li>Print your magazine-quality report, or save it as a PDF 
					file.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>2. If you need tables in your report, or if you want to 
				emphasize certain measures over others, you can use Version 2 of 
				the Database Dashboard Kit (DB2). It takes a little longer to 
				create your tables, but otherwise, the formulas, format, and 
				data worksheets are the same as for QnE2. </p>
				<p>3. If you want to learn how to create your own Excel 
				dashboard reports from scratch. My <em>Excel Dashboard E-Book 
				Kit </em>provides a 200-page e-book and sample files that teach 
				you what you need.<br />&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3>Overview of the Dashboard Kits</h3>
				<p>The reports in IncSight QnE2 and IncSight DB2 look like they 
				came from the pages of a business magazine. Unless you tell your 
				audience, they probably won't guess that you created your 
				reports in Excel.</p>
				<p>The dashboard kits are designed for Excel 2007, Mac Excel 
				2008, and above. (If you use earlier versions of Excel, see
				<a href="../templates/is-qne.htm">
				IncSight QnE</a>,
				<a href="../templates/is-db.htm">
				IncSight DB</a>, and
				<a href="../ebooks/ebook02.htm">
				Dashboard Reporting With Excel</a>.)</p>
				<p>I created these reports with one goal in mind: As Excel 
				users, our purpose is to communicate business information 
				clearly. That is, our purpose is <i>not</i> to impress our 
				audience with pretty pictures. </p>
				<p>
				Therefore, these reports avoid <i>chart junk</i>. This is Edward 
				Tufte's term for the distracting eye candy that many commercial 
				dashboard companies add to their expensive dashboard reports.
				</p>
				<p>Although the two IncSight dashboard kits use the same 30-page 
				instruction manual, you probably will need only its first two 
				pages, which offer Quick-Start instructions. Other pages explain 
				how to modify your dashboards, and explain some of their finer 
				points. For example, if you want to change from monthly reports 
				to daily reports, or if you want to report dozens of periods of 
				performance, the documentation explains how to do it.</p>
				<p>After your data is ready you should be able to create your 
				first dashboard report in an hour or two. And you should be able 
				to update your reports each month in less than five minutes. </p>
				<p>(Why does updating go so quickly? It's because you keep your 
				data in a separate data worksheet, which all your dashboard 
				reports can use. So you just update your data once; then in each 
				report workbook, you change the date in a cell to tell your 
				report to display your new data.) </p>
				<p>Later, if you care to do so, you can reduce your update time 
				to nearly nothing by using the techniques I describe in the <i>
				Excel Dashboard E-Book Kit.</i> For example, you could use 
				Excel's GETPIVOTDATA function to link your data worksheets to 
				PivotTables.</p>
				<p>To get started with either set of reports, you need to take 
				only three general steps:</p>
				<p><b>1. Choose a dashboard template workbook.</b> Each kit of 
				dashboard templates offers different report formats,<span class="style18"> 
				which I describe below</span>. And you'll find examples from 
				both <span class="style18">kits below</span>.</p>
				<p>
				<b>2. Enter your titles and data codes. </b>Each chart in a 
				report workbook is linked to a support worksheet, which uses 
				formulas to return data from your data worksheets. These 
				formulas rely on the report date and on the data codes you 
				assign to each row of data. The data codes could be product 
				codes, general ledger account numbers, SKUs, Series IDs, and so 
				on. To illustrate, if you want chart 5 to report data for code 
				C023, you enter &quot;C023&quot; in one cell in the support worksheet for 
				chart 5, and the formulas do the rest. </p>
				<p>If you own the <i>Excel Dashboard E-Book Kit </i>(below), you 
				can enter the formulas I discuss in chapters 6 - 8, formulas 
				that link your dashboard workbook to your Excel data worksheets, 
				or to corporate databases.</p>
				<p><b>3. Choose your color themes.</b> Each IncSight kit 
				includes two color themes. And additional color themes are 
				available. Use a simple Excel command to apply any color scheme 
				to your report workbook. Experiment until you find the one you 
				like best. If you don't like a particular color in one of the 
				color schemes, just change it. </p>
				<p>Then print your first report, or save it as a PDF file. </p>
				<p>Monthly, you can follow a simple process to update your 
				report quickly. Maintaining your report workbook is easy. There 
				are no macros to break. Nothing is hidden or protected. It's 
				just ordinary Excel.<br />&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3>Flexible Reporting</h3>
				<p>When you use your Excel dashboards for management reporting, 
				you'll have better results if you remember how flexible these 
				dashboards are. This flexibility can improve the value of your 
				reports significantly...</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Remember that when you create your first dashboard 
					report, the first measures you include don't need to be 
					perfectly chosen. This is because your audience quickly will 
					suggest other measures they want to see. <br />
					<br />
					For most &quot;real&quot; reporting solutions, changes like this can 
					be an expensive problem, but not for your dashboard 
					templates. If the data is available, you can replace one 
					measure with another in about ten seconds. So the important 
					thing is to get your first dashboard report into your 
					managers' hands as quickly as possible.<br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Remember that different managers have different 
					information needs...and that's okay. <br />
					<br />
					With normal Excel reports, that can be a huge problem 
					because normal Excel reports typically take a lot of time to 
					generate. But it's not a problem with these dashboards. This 
					is because you'll be able to open, update, and print each 
					manager's report in only a few seconds. So you could update 
					and generate dozens of different reports in less than half 
					an hour.<br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Remember that you can report data from <em>any</em> 
					source; you're not trapped within the limits of your 
					corporate database.<br />
					<br />
					So if your managers want your reports to include data from 
					&quot;silo&quot; systems, or from your web site, or about your 
					competitors, or about the economy, or from a log that some 
					intern maintains...that's not a problem. You just add the 
					data to your spreadsheet database and treat it like any 
					other data in your dashboard reports.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In &nbsp;short, I've designed these dashboard templates to be used 
				as a perpetual prototype that you can adapt quickly to changing 
				conditions, to changing opinions, to changing managers, and to 
				changes in your managers' information needs. So be sure to take 
				full advantage of this power.<br />&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3>Inexpensive Reporting</h3>

					<tr>
						<td>
						<em><strong>QnE2,</strong> using its default color 
						theme. All 34 QnE2 dashboard reports contain charts of 
						equal size. This makes it easy to choose a dashboard 
						with the number of charts you need.</em></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>Because of the value these kits offer, I originally planned to 
				charge several hundred dollars each for them. But I decided to 
				lower the price significantly, and then lower them even more for 
				this Introductory Sale. I want as many Excel users as possible 
				to be able to generate their own Excel dashboard reports, and a 
				price of hundreds of dollars is beyond the reach of many 
				budgets.</p>
				<p>Even so, the price would have been a huge bargain:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Commercial dashboard software typically costs tens of 
					thousands of dollars and takes many days to set up.<br />
					&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Custom Excel dashboard reports could cost thousands of 
					dollars for just a few reports. But my template kits include 
					20 report designs for IncSight DB2 and 34 designs for 
					IncSight QnE2...so the reports cost just a few bucks each.<br />
					&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Because none of the expensive solutions would allow you 
					to generate reports in a few hours, and modify them easily, 
					these kits offer significant benefits that the expensive 
					solutions lack.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>And you can save even more if you buy the kits in one of the 
				bundles I describe below.<br />&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3>The IncSight QnE Dashboard Kit</h3>
				<p>My <i>Quick-and-Easy Excel Dashboard Kit, Version 2, </i>
				(IncSight QnE2) is the quickest, easiest, and least-expensive 
				way I know for average Excel users to generate magazine-quality 
				Excel dashboard reports. </p>
				<p><span class="style18">This image</span> shows one of the 34 
				dashboard reports that the kit offers.</p>
				<p>QnE2 offers a matrix of equal-size charts per page, both 
				portrait and landscape. Thi<span class="style18">s design lets 
				you quickly create reports of the data your audience needs. This 
				kit can report as few as four charts (in a 2x2 matrix) to as 
				many as 25 charts in a portrait report (in a 5x5 matrix), or as 
				many as 28 charts in a landscape report (in a 7x4 matrix).
				</span></p>
				<p>By default, each chart in each report shows 13 months of 
				actual and targeted performance. If you don't have targets for 
				some of your measures, just set up your targets with zero 
				values. And the instructions explain how to report other time 
				periods, and to add or reduce the number of periods your 
				dashboards display.<br />&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3>The IncSight DB Dashboard Kit</h3>
				<p>IncSight DB was the first dashboard kit that was linked to 
				Excel worksheets in a separate database workbook. I considered 
				it to be my first &quot;real&quot; dashboard, so naturally 
				I named it &quot;DB&quot;, for &quot;Dash Board&quot;. Now, both DB2 and QnE2 can 
				report from the same data worksheets. </p>
				<p>
				When you compare this dashboard with the previous one, you'll 
				get a pretty good idea about how the packages differ. 
				Specifically... </p>
				<ol>
					<li>DB2 allows you to show both charts and small tables in 
					one report.<br />
					&nbsp; </li>
					<li>DB2 offers 20 individual portrait and landscape designs 
					rather than 34 designs that each use a matrix of charts of 
					the same size.<br />
					&nbsp; </li>
					<li>DB2 offers two different color themes than IncSight 
					QnE2.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Both IncSight DB, Version 2, and IncSight QnE, Version 2, use 
				the same database workbooks, and the same design for their data 
				support worksheets for charts. And they both share the same 
				users manual and Quick-Start instructions. So when you know how 
				to use one set of templates you know most of what you need for 
				the other.<br />&nbsp;
				</p>
				
				<h3>The IncSight Medley Dashboard Kit</h3>
			<p class="NoMarginTop">			
			These reports are dynamic, like all IncSight dashboard templates. 
			That means their formulas get their data from Excel data worksheets. 
			So as you change your report date, <strong>these reports update automatically</strong>, without VBA.</p>
				<p class="NoMarginTop">			
				Unlike other IncSight templates, these dashboard templates also support 
				dynamic text and multiple business units...like divisions, regions, 
				departments, and so on. So both the text and numbers in these dashboards<strong> update 
				automatically</strong> when you change your date or other 
				filters.</p>
				<p class="NoMarginTop">			
				The text from past reports is maintained in an Excel 
				Table, so you can review and resuse past comments and descriptions 
				easily.&nbsp; </p>
				<p>			
				The charts show targets as area 
				plots and actual performance as line plots.			
				If you don't have targets for your measures, you don't need to 
				show the area plots. And you can<strong> change the chart types easily</strong>; 
				the instruction manual explains how. <br />&nbsp;
				</p>
				
				<h3>The Excel Dashboard E-Book Kit</h3>
				<p>My ebook, <i>Dashboard Reporting With Excel</i>, teaches you 
				how to create Excel dashboards from scratch. It doesn't discuss 
				the reports on this page specifically, but it does explain how 
				to set up the charts, tables, and formatting that I used to 
				create these reports.</p>
				<p>The kit consists of the 200-page e-book and a package of more 
				than 20 files that the book discusses. Here are its major 
				topics:</p>
				<p><b>How to Create Mini-Charts.</b> Excel users often print 
				charts about the size of post cards. But business magazines 
				often print charts about the size of postage stamps. By using 
				small charts in our reports, we give our audience more insight 
				more quickly than any other method of reporting. Chapter 2 of 
				the e-book explain how to create those magazine-quality 
				&quot;mini-charts.&quot; And the workbooks that accompany the e-book 
				illustrate each step along the way.</p>
				<p><b>Other Useful Techniques for Dashboards.</b> Good 
				dashboards often require additional charting techniques. In 
				Chapter 3, I explain how to add an additional data series to a 
				chart, how to include multiple chart types, how to overlay two 
				charts to create special effects, how to use auto-shapes in 
				charts, and so on. This chapter also explains why you shouldn't 
				use gauges in dashboard reports.</p>
				<p><b>How to Create Figures that Use Both Charts and Worksheets.</b> 
				In dashboards, cell formatting, column widths, row heights, 
				special formulas, and other spreadsheet elements all combine 
				with charts to create the figures we see. Chapter 4 explains how 
				to use these elements in your dashboard reports.</p>
				<p>
				<b>Excel's Camera Tool.</b> This long-time Excel feature 
				probably is the most-useful feature that most Excel users have 
				never heard of. Also known as a <em>picture link,</em> it gives 
				you the ability to position live images of tables anywhere in 
				your dashboard report.&nbsp; </p>
				<p>And because you even can set up a formula that determines 
				which of several live images to display, the Camera tool allows 
				you to include &quot;traffic light&quot; figures in your reports. Chapter 
				5 discusses the Camera tool in detail, and the sample files 
				include working examples.</p>
				<p><b>Linking Your Reports to Databases.</b> You can set up your 
				dashboard reports to return data from an Excel database, a 
				PivotTable, or an Excel-friendly OLAP database. Chapter 6 
				discusses techniques for using PivotTables and Excel databases, 
				and it touches on techniques for using OLAPs. And Chapter 7 
				discusses Excel databases in detail.</p>
				<p><b>How to Create an Excel Dashboard From Scratch.</b> Chapter 
				8 begins with an empty spreadsheet and ends with a completed 
				dashboard report, showing you each step along the way. The files 
				that come with the kit include the dashboard, which is linked to 
				an Excel database. </p>
				<p><b>Dashboard Design Ideas. </b>Business magazines are an 
				excellent source for dashboard design ideas. To help you get the 
				most from those magazines, Chapter 9 provides a wide variety of 
				magazine figures, and shows Excel versions of those figures. The 
				files include the actual spreadsheets that duplicate the 
				magazines' charts and tables.<br />&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3>Bonus Dashboard Files with the Bundle</h3>
				<p>
				You can save money when you buy the dashboard and E-Book kits 
				together. When you do so, you also receive one or both of the 
				bonus dashboard <span class="style18">packages shown below.
				</span></p>
				<p>The<em> Business Week</em> page in <strong>Bonus 1</strong> 
				is based on a design that BW used in the early 1990s to describe 
				economic performance for the week. I changed its red and yellow 
				colors, to show <i>Performance for the Month</i>. </p>
				<p>The <em>Forbes</em> page is based on a design that Forbes 
				magazine used in the 1990s, also to display economic 
				performance. I turned it into an <i>Executive Overview</i>. </p>
				<p>This dashboard is unusual because it uses only one chart. 
				However, notice that it contains seven short tables, each of 
				which summarizes key information that could serve as a reference 
				for managers. </p>
				<p>Let me reassure you that it doesn't matter what your numbers 
				and text represent. You could use pages like this to report 
				customer traffic, car traffic, or astronomical observations. 
				Excel doesn't care. That is, these reports aren't limited to 
				financial and marketing information.</p>
				<p>The <em>Business Week</em> page in <strong>Bonus 2</strong> 
				is based on a design that BW used for several years, until 
				Bloomberg bought the publication. I offer it as
				<a href="../charts/file021.htm">
				Charley's Swipe File #21</a>. It illustrates the basics of 
				showing text in a dashboard page.</p>
				<p>The second page is very unusual, because it displays 110 
				charts on one printed page. This is the only workbook among my 
				dashboard products that contains a macro. First you format the 
				top-left chart any way you want. Then you run the well-commented 
				macro to create the remaining charts. Each chart gets its data 
				from another data set in the workbook. <br />&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3>How to Avoid the Coming Price Increase</h3>
				<p>I recently hired a <i>very</i> expensive web marketing firm 
				to advise me. Their first recommendation was to increase all my 
				prices by five to ten times.</p>
				<p>The consultants pointed out that...</p>
				<ul>
					<li>My customers get better insight about their 
					organizations much more quickly, and with much less work 
					than with many commercial Business Intelligence (BI) 
					products. <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Considering what many managers are paid, and what the 
					value of good decisions are worth, this benefit is worth 
					thousands of dollars. <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>My customers will be able to use Excel software they 
					already own instead of buying and learning commercial BI 
					software. And this saves tens of thousands of dollars. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>I've been charging way, WAY too little for these benefits, 
				they told me.</p>
				<p>Honestly, I'm resisting the idea, because I don't want to 
				price the dashboards beyond the budgets of small companies, 
				divisions, hospitals, cities, and other under-funded 
				organizations around the world. </p>
				<p>In fact, to introduce Version 2 of IncSight DB and QnE, I've 
				cut prices even further and added the Dashboard Bonuses you see 
				here.</p>
				<p>I can't guarantee how long these low prices and bonuses will 
				last. So you'll save money and get more free stuff if you act 
				now.<br />&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions about the Kits</h3>
				<p>
				<img class="image-inline" alt="" height="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" width="8" />&nbsp;
				<i>What kind of guarantee do you offer?</i></p>
				<p>I offer an unconditional <strong>ONE-YEAR </strong>money-back 
				guarantee. This is the best guarantee I've ever seen in the 
				software industry.</p>
				<img class="image-inline"  alt="" height="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" width="8" />&nbsp;
				<i>Can I get a receipt so my company will reimburse me for my 
				purchase?</i><p>Certainly. You'll receive one type of receipt 
				within minutes of purchase. If it doesn't meet your needs, just
				<a href="mailto:kyd@exceluser.com">email me</a>. I'll send you 
				another version with more complete information. And if that 
				doesn't work let me know. One way or the other, I'll get you 
				what you need.</p>
				<p>
				<img class="image-inline"  alt="" height="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" width="8" />&nbsp;
				<i>My company paid for your product. How can I get a legal copy 
				for myself?<br />
				<img class="image-inline"  alt="" height="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" width="8" />&nbsp; 
				I paid for your product. How can I get a legal copy for my 
				company?</i></p>
				<p>I give you permission to use <em>one</em> copy of my products 
				for your personal use and <em>one</em> copy for your employer. 
				So you're actually getting two copies for the price of one!</p>
				<p>Of course, you also can distribute your actual reports as 
				needed.</p>
				<p>
				<img class="image-inline"  alt="" height="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" width="8" />&nbsp;
				<i>How soon will the kits arrive?</i></p>
				<p>Within minutes after you place your order you'll receive an 
				email message with download links. Just click the links to 
				download your files immediately. Nothing will be shipped to you.</p>
				<p>
				<img class="image-inline"  alt="" height="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" width="8" />&nbsp;
				<i>If my hard drive crashes, or I change jobs, can I get another 
				copy?</i></p>
				<p>No problem. This happens all the time. Just send me an email 
				message and I'll send you another download link. </p>
				<p>
				<img class="image-inline"  alt="" height="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" width="8" />&nbsp;
				<em>What file formats do the e-book and documentation use</em><i>?</i></p>
				<p>Both documents are delivered as zipped PDF files. In the off 
				chance that you don't already have Adobe Acrobat PDF Reader, you 
				can
				<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html" rel="nofollow" target="NewWindow">
				download a free copy here</a>. </p>
				<p>
				<img class="image-inline"  alt="" height="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" width="8" />&nbsp;
				<i>What payment methods do you offer?</i></p>
				<p>
				<img alt="Credit Cards" height="33" src="../../images/tools/5creditcards-w250.gif" width="250" />You 
				can use one of the payment methods shown at the right. Or, if 
				you want to send a check in US Dollars,
				<a href="mailto:kyd@exceluser.com">email me</a> for further 
				instructions. However, I will say that we've sold thousands of 
				products by credit card and PayPal, and haven't had one security 
				problem.</p>
				<p>
				<img class="image-inline"  alt="" height="8" src="../../images/tools/pipblk.gif" width="8" />&nbsp;
				<i>What's your email policy?</i></p>
				<p>I'll <em>never</em> sell or give your email address to 
				others. And I won't spam you myself. Personally, I receive more 
				than a thousand spams a day, and I don't intend to add to this 
				worldwide problem.<br />&nbsp;
				</p>
